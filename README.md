## Why Rust?

**Memory Safety and Ownership Mechanism**: 
When solving algorithm problems in Rust, I’m forced to think carefully about memory layout and lifetimes. These low-level constraints often expose issues early and help me write more robust code.

**Performance**: 
As a systems-level language, Rust delivers performance comparable to C++, which makes it well-suited for algorithm practice without worrying about efficiency bottlenecks.

**Toolchain**: 
Cargo provides a clean and powerful workflow for dependency management and testing. It makes the transition from isolated algorithm solutions to small experiments or projects very smooth.

**Mindset shift**: Moving from a mostly imperative style to Rust’s hybrid paradigm (ownership, traits, iterators, and functional patterns) has been a meaningful shift in how I think about programming.
